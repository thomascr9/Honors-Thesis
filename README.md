# Honors-Thesis

This is the repository containing my final products for my Honors Thesis. For my thesis, I have developed a Shiny App to be used during batting practice to record the pitches that each player sees. Once recording the data, it can be analyzed and outputs a report of the practice containing team and player summaries.
