# Honors-Thesis

This is the repository containing my final products for my Honors Thesis. For my thesis, I have developed a Shiny App to be used during batting practice to record the pitches that each player sees. Once recording the data, it can be analyzed and outputs a report of the practice containing team and player summaries.

The working Shiny app can be accessed here: https://caroline-thomas.shinyapps.io/softballapp/

Tutorials for use of the app and on running the analysis using the collected data can be found on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLonGs-oj4UGBcBxyflNtDNxNG9d725Okb
